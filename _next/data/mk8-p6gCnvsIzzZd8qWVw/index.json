Outside of work, I'm a father, football enthusiast, and amateur cook.\n\nMy professional journey has taken me through diverse sectors—from major retailers and insurance companies to Brazil's largest payment sub-acquirer and the production company behind Latin America's most-viewed YouTube channel. I've contributed to innovative projects including web development platforms, pioneered Progressive Web Apps in Brazil (2016), and co-founded a technology startup.\n\nWith over a decade of professional experience, I specialize in distributed cloud architecture, scalable systems, and applying AI solutions to complex business challenges. I'm passionate about elegant code, effective communication, and creating technology that makes a difference.","career":"Career Highlights","previous_experience":"Diverse Industry Experience","industries":"Retail, Fintech, Media, Payments","specializations":"Backend & Cloud Architecture","journey_title":"My Professional Evolution","journey_description":"From full-stack to specialized backend engineering, my focus has evolved to building scalable, robust systems."},"Contact":{"section-name":"Contact me","paragraph":"Wanna talk to me about technology, work or something interesting?
