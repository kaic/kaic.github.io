I currently work at Nubank—the most prominent digital bank in Latin America and a global player—on the homepage team, one of the most visited parts of the app. I’ve been working with distributed systems, performance, and scalable architecture, contributing to initiatives like load optimizations, legacy component migrations, and refactors that reduce complexity and tech debts. I also support teammates, write technical documentation, and have been increasingly involved in architecture discussions.\n\nMy journey includes experiences across industries like payments, digital media, retail, and social impact. I started as a full-stack developer and have worked across backend, frontend, mobile, and infrastructure, which gave me a solid foundation to navigate different contexts and teams. I’m familiar with large-scale environments, deploying pipelines, monitoring, and all the little (but critical) details that keep a system running.\n\nI care about clean code — but mostly about code that can be maintained over time. I believe technology is a means, not an end. And that we’re always in motion — learning, adapting, and building together.\n\nOutside of work, I’m a father, a football enthusiast, and a hobbyist cook — always looking for the next great dish, game, or learning opportunity.","career":"Career Highlights","previous_experience":"Diverse Industry Experience","industries":"Retail, Fintech, Media, Payments","specializations":"Backend & Cloud Architecture","journey_title":"My Professional Evolution","journey_description":"From full-stack to specialized backend engineering, my focus has evolved to building scalable, robust systems."},"Contact":{"section-name":"Contact me","paragraph":"Wanna talk to me about technology, work or something interesting?
