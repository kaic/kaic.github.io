Outside of work, I'm a father, football enthusiast, and amateur cook, and occasionally you'll find me playing something on my PC or reading.\n\nI started programming at 12, creating scripts for GTA San Andreas mods and playing with HTML/CSS on Blogspot and forum tools. At 15, I began formal studies in Computer Science in high school, when I started to understand how computers work and decided to pursue a career in software engineering.\nAt 18, two important milestones happened in my life: I became a father and landed my first job as an intern at a development consultancy in São Paulo.\nSince then, I've worked on projects for major retailers, insurance companies, Brazil's largest sub-acquirer, and the production company behind Latin America's biggest YouTube channel. I helped develop a web IDE, implemented one of Brazil's first PWA sites in production (2016), and co-founded a startup.\nCurrently, I focus on distributed cloud architecture, large-scale systems, development best practices, communication, and LLMs."},"Contact":{"paragraph":"Wanna talk to me about technology, work or something interesting?
